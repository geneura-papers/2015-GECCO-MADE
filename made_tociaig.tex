\begin{abstract}

In the present work, we design and evaluate a method to procedurally
create coherent backstories for non-player characters where
\textit{the monomyth}, also called \textit{the hero's journey}, has to emerge.
The \textit{monomyth} is a template that conforms to myths, ancient and modern, from cultures across the world and links different characters and archetypes. It is present in novels\notaruben{Lovecraft, por ejemplo http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/ masters/277/}, films\notaruben{The Monomyth in American Science Fiction Films: 28 Visions of the Hero's Journey} and videogames\notaruben{skyrim, mass effect (http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/ handle/2123/8902), zelda, etc}, and different researches use it to model interesting plots in virtual worlds\notaruben{por ejemplo este http://mud.co.uk/richard/ CGAIDE94.pdf}, thus we use it a metric of interest in backstories.
We formally analyze the archetypes present in \textit{the monomyth} using predicate logic and provide the basis to model facts
of the world in a declarative paradigm. Then, general constraints for
future implementations are defined. On this basis, we model the
characters as intelligent agents using deterministic finite
automata, and fitness functions using logical deductions on the
world's facts, in a hybrid three-layered \textit{Evolutionary
  Computation - Agent Based Model} approach that optimally
parametrizes the agents. The analysis of the results show that we are able to obtain the parameters of the agents that, after the execution in a massive
multi-agent virtual simulation, better allow the emergence of the
complex patterns present in \textit{the monomyth}.
Then, the facts of the world inhabited by these agents can be used as the backstories of the characters that populate an open world videogame. The present paper will provide as example a literary narration of a backstory created with the best parameters found.
The method described can also be applied to different game settings or
characters' nature by re-implementing the Agent's layer using the
rules provided in this paper.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Videogames have evolved into a mass medium. According to the report by
the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) \cite{esa_ef_2014}, 59\%
of the US citizens play videogames and the total consumer spend on
games in US reaches \$21,53 billions. The computer and video game
industry in US directly and indirectly employs more than 146,000
people \cite{esa_century_2014}. In this very competitive context, the
Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is gaining more and more
popularity in the last few years due to the cost reduction and
re-playability it offers to the developers. To give an example,
\textit{No man's sky}, an indie adventure videogame where planets,
fauna and flora are created procedurally, won three Game Critics
Awards, including Best Original Game and the Special Commendation for
Innovation, in the past Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, a
reference annual trade show for the video game
industry\footnote{\url{http://www.gamecriticsawards.com/winners.html}}. 

In videogames, non-player characters usually interact with the main
players in order to combat, offer information to complete goals or
provide realism and aliveness to the virtual world. In open worlds
where thousand of characters coexist, a procedural method to generate
them is mandatory, and the realism of the world will be affected
drastically by it.

Our previous researches confirmed that a hybrid \textit{Evolutionary Computation - Agent Based Model} (EC-ABM) methodology could be used to emerge archetypes. In \cite{garcia14my} we proposed the use of simple agents and behavior patterns, and proved that a Genetic Algorithm could lead to a parametrization of the agents that made different archetypes emerge. In \cite{garcia2015world} we analyzed the effect of the genetic and non-genetic parameters (such as the map size available food per virtual day or initial number of agents), and found out that the existence of conflicts is essential for the emergence of most of our archetypes, that different archetypes need different types of conflicts and that, in many cases, conflicts are also emergent. However, these works didn't use formal models to define the archetypes or the facts of the virtual world and no rules could be provided to establish whether or not a design of an agent could lead to the appearance of the archetypes. For this reason in the present paper we formally model the archetypes using predicate logic. A logical model allows us to describe the archetypes in a way close to the natural language, provides the formalism and syntax of the mathematical language and is easily transformable to a computer program in a declarative paradigm. This logical model also allows us to define requirements of the ABM layer and, following them, design a new more complex finite state automaton that better fits the archetypes needs.
