# MADE paper for GECCO 2015

First stage submission: Abstract.

## Title

This means war: exploring the sources of conflict in virtual worlds 

## Abstract

The content industry needs a way to procedurally design interesting stories that
act as backstories for characters or as background for a massive
multiplayer world. MADE is a framework that uses genetic algorithms to evolve worlds in which
user-defined archetypes arise. In previous papers we have found that 
the existence of conflicts is essential
for the emergence of most archetypes. However, different archetypes
need different types of conflicts and, in many cases, conflicts are also
emergent, so in this paper we will present a general methodology for
setting the parameters and conditions of the actions that influence 
these conflicts for a particular virtual world.
