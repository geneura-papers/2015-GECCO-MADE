# MADE paper for GECCO 2015

First stage submission: Abstract.

## Title

This means war: exploring the sources of conflict in virtual worlds 

## Abstract

The content industry needs a way to design interesting stories that
act as backstories for characters or as background for a massive
multiplayer world. MADE is a framework that evolves world in which
user-defined archetypes arise. Most archetypes are based in conflict,
and in previous papers we have found that their existence is essential
for the emergence of most archetypes. However, different archetypes
need different types of conflict, and in any case conflict is also
emergent, so in this paper we will present a general methodology for
setting the parameters of a virtual world so that it gives rise to the
archetypes the user needs for it.
