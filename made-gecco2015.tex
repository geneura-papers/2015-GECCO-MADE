\begin{abstract}

The content industry needs a way to procedurally design interesting stories that
act as backstories for characters or as background for a massive
multiplayer world. MADE is a framework that uses genetic algorithms to evolve worlds in which
user-defined archetypes arise. In previous papers we have found that 
the existence of conflicts is essential
for the emergence of most archetypes. However, different archetypes
need different types of conflicts and, in many cases, conflicts are also
emergent, so in this paper we will present a general methodology for
setting the parameters and conditions of the actions that influence 
these conflicts for a particular virtual world.

\section{Introduction}


In the last few years, procedural content generation (PGC for further references) 
is attracting more and more interest in the area of videogames development.
Different productions, where PGC is applied, are winning international awards for the first time, proving that this methodology can also be an added value due to the re-playability and richness of the result, attributes very appreciated by the videogames players.
To give an example, No man's sky, an adventure videogame where planets, fauna and flora are created procedurally, won several Game Critics Awards in the past E3 2014\footnote{http://www.gamecriticsawards.com/winners.html}.

According to the classification by Hendrikx et Al. \cite{Hendrikx:2013:PCG:2422956.2422957}, PGC can be applied to many different areas in videogames, such as derived content, design, scenarios, systems, space or game units. This paper is focused in the creation of scenarios, and more specifically in the backstories of the non-player characters (for further references, NPC) in massive worlds, that would be used to provide realism, create an interesting atmosphere and allow the appearance of possible secondary goals supported at the NPCs' actions in the past.

% Antonio - ¿qué quiere decir esto de los objetivos secundarios?. Aclararlo
% Rubén - Básicamente que esas backstories también podrían usarse para
% generar objetivos secundarios del juego

In this context, and following the work by Garc\'ia-Ortega et Al. \cite{garcia14my}, 
% Antonio - Si nos vamos a ¡apoyar' en conclusiones o cosas hechas en artículos anteriores, mejor anonimizarlo y usarlo así. ;)
creating backstories using a hybrid \textit{Evolutionary Computation - Agent-Based Model} approach (for further references EC-ABM) have proved to work in virtual words where agents with particular personalities or \textit{profiles} live in a \textit{map} and interact in a \textit{space-time} dimension, leading to the emergence of high level behaviors or \textit{archetypes}.
These archetypes are selected by the designer  
% Antonio - explicar cómo y cuándo se seleccionan. ;)
of the videogame depending of the setting needs, before the evolutionary
algorithm is executed. The solution obtained encodes the profile of the agents whose lives would show the desirable archetypes when they are placed in the virtual world.

That work showed that sensible non-evolutionary parameters as the number of agents, the world size, the execution time, or the source of conflicts affect dramatically to the quality of the solution yielded by the EC-ABM approach.
We will say that the quality of a solution is directly proportional to the emergence of archetypes, although this asseveration will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:exp}.
% Antonio - Explicar qué se considera la calidad de una solución.
% RUbén - OK
Thus, the appearance of conflicts promotes the appearance of archetypes, hence, better solutions.
% Antonio - Esto no se ha comentado antes. Es decir, no se deja claro que la presencia de más arquetipos es mejor. ¿Por qué lo es?
% Rubén - Lo explicaré en el exprimental setup, pero aun debo buscar algunas referencias
% Esto de 'ergo' queda muy de Matrix Reloaded. XD
% Rubén - Cambiado por hence

In this paper, we focus on these conflict-based archetypes and classify them based on their relation to the source of conflict, allowing the creator of a story to promote their appearance by tuning the parameters of the evolutive algorithm (EA).
% Antonio - más que 'predict' quizá fuese mejor 'promote', ¿no? ;D
% Rubén - Sí :-)
Also, different conflict-based patterns extracted from classical literature are described, designed and used in the experiments. 

% Antonio - ¿'proposed' por qué o con qué objetivo?¿'designed' en que sentido?
% Rubén - Para poder usarlos en los experimentos. Añadido.
In order to implement these archetypes, the MADE open source simulator\footnote{http://made.velonuboso.com} is used.
% Antonio - URL o referencia
In MADE, every individual of the evolutionary algorithm is modeled with a chromosome that represents the parameters of one (or several kinds of) finite state machine (FSM) \cite{FSM_Booth} that is set to \textit{live} (interact) in a simulated environment.
% Antonio - Yo explicaría más de MADE, o quitaría lo de works as follows, que predece a una explicación 'extensa'. :D
% Rubén - Ok

On the other hand, promoting different archetypes relies in an appropriate fitness function for a virtual world, but also in the operators and the EA parameters chosen.
% Antonio - referencia que indique esto
% Anotnio - yo discrepo en todo caso. El fitness puede diseñarse para eso, pero no es la ñunica forma de que surjan arquetipos diferentes. Se puede jugar con los operadores (cruce, mutación, por ejemplo) o con los parámetros, como se indicó antes.
% Rubén - Añadida la nota
In this paper we propose and test different approaches 
% Antonio - aclarar de qué son los 'approaches'. ;D
% Rubén - TODO
based in 
% Antonio - ¿properties of?
the archetypes of the agents that inhabit the world, their speed of apparition and their distribution,
% Antonio - decir exáctamente las que se usen. Lo de ETC no queda nada bien, pero es que aquí es importante señalar las que se hayan considerado y justificarlas, claro. ;)
% Rubén - Ok y TODO
selecting those that generate better solutions in the experiments performed.
% Antonio - ¿Estos experimentos se refieren a los del artículo anterior o a este? Si es a este, deberías dar más énfasis a ese 'selecting'. ¿En base a qué se seleccionarán? ¿qué son 'better solutions'? Se hará algo más que seleccionarlas, ya que se justificarán y se analizarán, supongo. ;)

% Antonio - En general hay que darle más bombo al 'selling point', justificarlo mejor (por qué es este el siguiente paso y no otro, por ejemplo) y explicar mejor lo que se va a hacer (que es una metodología, que pretende falicitar las cosas a tales personas y por tal medio, etc). ;)

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Coming up next, we present the state of the art in the definition, classification and evaluation
of conflict-based archetypes. 
% Antonio - ¿Hay un estado del arte ta específico? Es una duda, si lo hay, estupendo.
% Rubén - Era la idea pero aun no tengo claro
The next section \ref{sec:met} presents the methodology, 
% Antonio - ¿La metodología para hacer qué?
followed by the experimental setup in Section \ref{sec:exp}, whose results are shown and analysed in Section \ref{sec:res}. Finally, we present our conclusions in the last section.

\section{State of the Art}
\label{sec:sota}

%According to the taxonomy described by Togelius et al. \cite{togelius2011search}
%the problem of massively generating backstories for non-player
%characters (NPCs) can be considered \textit{Procedural content
%generation (PCG)}, since it implies the generation of the characters and their relations in the game world. In this paper,
%we have used an \textit{offline} approach since the computation is
%done in the phase of game design, also considered \textit{search-based} due to the use of an evolutionary algorithm.
%This paper is focused in the context of computational generation of massive plots without human interaction, and driven by goals proposed by the creator. Different approaches have been proposed in previous works (see the work of Arinbjarnar et al. \cite{arinbjarnar2009critical} for a survey). 
%
%In 1976 the program called \textit{Tale-Spin} \cite{meehan1976metanovel} was able to produce
%purely text-based fairy tales where semi-autonomous characters
%showed emotions and relationships, with the shortcoming of creating very inconsistent plots.
%Then, different researches used the concept of \textit{goals and pre-defined
%stories} to construct stories: In 1987, UNIVERSE \cite{lebowitz1985story}
%was used to create infinite soap opera style stories driven by
%goals provided by the author. It used fragments of stories to assign
%roles to stereotypical characters, relying on the reader the assumption
%of the characters' motivations.
%In 1994, Turner created Minstrel \cite{turner2014creative}, a program which used 
%case-based reasoning to generate stories about knights and ladies by replacing variables in existing stories and recombining them. It also used goals, in this case for the story and for every character. In 2008, Riedl and Leon
% used in \cite{riedl2008toward} the same idea, conceptualizing a vignette
%as a small story assumed as `interesting', thus they can compose complete stories when exposed sequentially.
%
%The technique applied in this paper can be understood as the evolution of
%these researches adapted to massive worlds, where coherence is provided by the use of an Agent-Based Model (ABM for further references).
%Instead of using `vignettes' to construct stories, our approach
%modifies the behavior of the agents and finds `archetypes', i.e. behaviors and patterns universally accepted and present in the
%collective imaginary \cite{garry2005archetypes}.
%
%The idea of emerging plots from agents' interactions, that is, using
%agent-based models of the world to generate stories is not new. In 2007, Virtual storyteller \cite{swartjes2007emergent}, used agents that improvise using techniques from improvisational theater, a plot guide and a narrator. Our technique uses the same approach but there is no plot guide agent. Instead, a Genetic Algorithm (GA)  guides the mood of the backstories created by finding `archetypes' (selected by the user).
%
%The search of a good plot can be addressed from the Evolutionary Computation (EC) point of view. To this aim in 2011, Nairat et al. proposed in \cite{nairat2011character} a generative drama approach
%that integrates human creativity by using an agent-based system where
%the characters are developed using interactive evolution. One year later, 
%Cioffi-Revilla et al. \cite{cioffi2012evolutionary} published a study that
%applies a combined EC-ABM approach to the challenge of understanding
%complex adaptive systems in social science. Their conclusions suggest further applications of EC to ABM in terms of multi-population models with heterogeneous agents, multi-objective optimization, dynamic environments, and evolving executable objects for modeling social change.
%
%Our approach relies on this idea by using a GA to 
%obtain the agents' life story that better fits the goals described by the user/author before the world is generated. It follows the methodology presented in \cite{garcia14my}: systematize the generation of backstories in massive worlds, defining the elements of a complex world, and optimize the characters' behavior using GAs to extract information.
%Moreover, that work included a preliminary analysis of only one parameter: the number of profiles to use. Results in that paper shown that this parameter have a significant influence
%in the archetype-based fitness attained. The open-source simulator 
%MADE used in the present work, was also introduced in that paper. However, the rest of parameters that conform the fictional setting (defined in 
%\cite{morrell2006between}) were set as standard ad-hoc parameters. 
%
%
%In this research, we want to extend the previous study testing the rest of the
%parameters that model a story: the time, the world, the characters and
%the source of conflicts.
%These parameters might have a huge effect in the plot generation, where small variations could substantially alter the results, or on the other hand, some of them may be superfluous.

\section{Methodology} %Issue #12
\label{sec:met}

%As mentioned in section \ref{sec:sota}, the proposed technique for generating fictional worlds 
%relies in the use of a a combined EC-ABM approach (a GA in this case).
%The fitness function is configurable to fit the story needs.
%Then, some parameters have to be fixed: world constants, agents' constants and GA parameters.
%Finally, the GA has to search in a noisy space, due to the stochastic nature of the approach.
%The influence of each constant and parameter is, \textit{a priori}, impossible to predict.
%
%Our methodology systematizes the study of key parameters in the massive generation of backstories with an
%EC-ABM approach
%in order to optimize the resources allocated to evolution and to have some
%guarantees that the final result will be close to the optimum.
%
%\subsection{Problem characterization}
%\label{subsec:idio}
%
%
%This methodology  addresses to problems with the following characteristics:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Goal: The final goal is to generate stochastic virtual worlds massively inhabited by characters with backstories that are aligned with a mood defined by the writer.
%\item Virtual world: The virtual world is modeled by the ABM.
%\item Archetype: An archetype is a behavior pattern that can be present in a backstory.
%\item Fitness: The evaluation of the virtual world can be based in the rates of archetypes (set by the writer) found in the characters that inhabit it.
%\item Backstory: The backstory of a character is a set of actions and interpretations, coherent with the virtual world and the other agents.
%\item Agent: The agent represents a character that performs actions in the virtual world depending on the neighborhood and its internal state.
%\item Profile: The agents can be parametrized and their behavior
%  (probabilities to perform actions) depends on these parameters. The
%  profile (P) is the set of values for these parameters and is
%  optimized by the GA. 
%\item Conflict: Every action is performed in a place and a time,
%  affects to one or more agents and relates to the source of conflict.
%\item Place: The agents occupy a location in a map, defined by its size (W).
%\item Time: The world exists during a period of time (D). Every backstory is fed by actions as time goes by, in a bottom-up approach.
%\item Source of conflict: The element that forces the agents to interact. For example, in this study, the food (F) can be considered as the source of conflicts between the agents; the element that the agents compete for.
%\item Scenario: A set of archetypes that have to emerge.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%
%\subsection{Parameter effects}
%\label{subsec:params}
%
%As Morrell explains in \cite{morrell2006between}, ``fiction has three main elements:
%plotting, character, and place or setting'', so, intuitively, these three elements can affect the backstories. 
%In our problem, an agent is ruled by its profile, which defines its behavior.
%Our technique uses the GA to evolve the profile(s) of the agents,
%so it will be part of the search space.
%Nevertheless, the use of different number of profiles (P) may also affect the behavior of the agents, since more profiles
%in the same world may imply new types of conflicts (as it was demonstrated in \cite{garcia14my}).
%
%The plotting is the result of the different conflicts, that are affected by the place,
%the time and the source of conflicts, which in this case is the food.
%
%The place is defined by the size ($W$). Smaller maps usually imply more friction between the agents,
%thus different variations of $W$ may derive in different behaviors. The values that should be chosen
%are those that test a size smaller or equal to the neighborhood defined (letting all the agents
%access to all the resources and positions of the world), a size bigger than the neighborhood
%(forcing the agents to move to reach a new neighborhood) and much bigger (showing the effects
%of having a big inhabited world).
%
%The time of the conflict is affected by the period of time that the world is given to run (D).
%In this sense, a longer period of time will usually imply more interactions, \textit{ergo} more
%archetypes and better fitness, and eventually more agents in the world. In the other hand, the evaluation
%of an individual in the GA implies the execution of every agent and the evaluation of each backstory,
%thus more agents and bigger backstories may increment significantly the evaluation time.
%The values proposed for the study vary from a very short period of time to a bigger one, where the
%maximum is the agent's average lifetime. The food is modeled with the parameter (F). Changes in this parameter may increment or decrease
%the number of interactions.
%
%Finally, exploration of the search space might be affected by the GA parameters. In this sense, the most significant
%parameter is the population size (S), since bigger populations will provide more accuracy but spend more execution time.
%
%To sum up, our methodology will systematically combine more than two variants of five parameters
%and study how the fitness is affected. The parameters proposed for the problems characterized in
%subsection \ref{subsec:idio} are the number of profiles (P), the world size (W),
%the virtual time (D), the food (F) and the population size of the GA (S).
%
%
%
%\subsection{Problem specification}
%
%
%
%An agent in the MADE world is a representation of a brown rat
%modeled as a finite automaton that performs actions like move, eat, attack,
%defend, escape, find mate or breed.
%
%The place where the conflicts appear is a square grid. A cell can only be occupied by one agent.
%Each agent can move and interact with other agents in a neighborhood of 7x7 cells around the rat. 
%The time is a number of `virtual days'.
%The rats are driven to survive and to have offspring, thus
%the source of conflicts is the food: 
%agents attacks themselves to steal food before it is eaten by 
%other agents. Systematically, a number of food rations appears in random positions on the map every virtual day.
%An agent may die of starvation, due to the damage inflicted by other agent or
%because its older.
%
%
%MADE lets the writer select different archetypes that can be promoted in the world
%as described in \cite{garcia14my}.
%In this paper we will study three different archetypes: An agent
%is considered a \textit{villain} if it kills other agent as a result of a fight for the food,
%a \textit{hero} if it attacks a \textit{villain} and an
%\textit{avenger} if it attacks other agent in revenge.
%
%The fitness of the world is the sum of the value for each archetype rate, i.e. 
%the number of characters that present the archetype divided by the total number of characters.
%To promote the appearance of all the archetypes, avoiding as much as possible the 
%lack of any of them, the function presents a logarithmic curve where
%small rates get bigger values. As a consequence, the fitness of a world with a
%presence of two archetypes whose rate is 0.25 is bigger than the fitness of a world
%with one archetype whose rate is 0.5.
%The function used by MADE is described as: 
%
%
%\begin{equation}
%F_A= \sum _{i=1}^{A} {{\log \left( 1+10r_{i}\right) } \over {\log 11}},F_A\in\left[0,A\right]
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent where $A$ is the number of archetypes that takes part in the fitness and $r_{i}$ is the
%appearance rate of the archetype $i$ in the world, being $r_{i} \in \left[ 0 , 1 \right]$.
%
%
%\subsection{Converting logs to stories}
%
%Once the best values of the parameters have been found, the system can be run
%inside a game context to generate a whole set of secondary characters.
%For the simple reason of using agents in a bottom-up approach for the world generation, MADE provides a social network with family relationships, but also other related to the disputes and to possible archetypes, i.e. in our study, a `hero' fights a `villain' or an `avenger' takes revenge on other character.
%
%The storyteller will be able to tell a story about each character by accessing to its life-log. The life-log should have a pre-defined format understandable by the storyteller, with fields like the date, the action performed, the internal state, the direct object and the indirect object.
%Moreover, each agent should be tagged with the different archetypes it fulfills, the days that this archetype begins and ends, and the agents affected.
%
%With this information within reach, the storyteller can create a story about the character by narrating its birthday, its name, the name and story of its parents, siblings and children (also using this technique for describing them), what the agent is (as archetype: `villain', `hero', `avenger') and why (dates, characters related and supposed motivations).

Following the analysis available in \ref{RomeoJuliet_tvtropes}, Romeo and Juliette present
at least 12 tropes. The summary plot is provided in terms of tropes: ``\textit{Boy Meets Girl}. It's \textit{Love at First Sight}. But Boy and Girl are members of \textit{Feuding Families}. \textit{Boy secretly marries Girl}. Boy's friend is murdered by Girl's cousin, so \textit{Boy kills Girl's cousin}, then skips town. Girl agrees to \textit{dangerous plot} to avoid an \textit{Arranged Marriage} set up by her parents. Plot \textit{goes horribly right}. Boy, hearing of Girl's "death," returns to town and \textit{kills self} at her grave. Girl, \textit{waking and discovering this}, \textit{kills self} in turn. \textit{Grief-stricken families reconcile}. \textit{The End}!''.

%As explained in subsection \ref{subsec:params}, the parameters 
%whose effect will be studied are the number of profiles (P), the world size (W),
%the virtual time (D), the food (F) and the population size of the GA (S).
%Different parameter values for each element will be studied to clarify
%their influence in the literary world generation, following the rules and 
%recommendations presented in subsection \ref{subsec:params}.
%
%Since the size of the neighborhood is a square of 7x7 cells, the selected
%values for (W) are 5x5, 10x10 and 20x20 cells. Furthermore, these sizes would
%allow the existence of 25, 100 and 400 agents
%respectively at the same time.
%
%Also, as the maximum lifetime of the agent is about 300 virtual days,
%the selected set of days (D) to study are 64, 128 and 256. More days would result in a
%huge amount of agents and backstories, harder to evaluate.
%
%
%
%The set of values for the food (F), or source of conflicts, that conditions the actions
%(attack, share and defend, among others) are 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 of the number of cells of the map.
%
%The set of values proposed for the population size (S) 
%of the GA are 64, 128 and 256 individuals.
%
%Finally, it is expected that the existence of different number of profiles (P)
%in the world will have a significant effect in the runs, 
%specially in functions that require more than one archetype.
%We will compare the usage of 1, 2, 4 and 8 profiles for each scenario.
%As the usage of different number of profiles generate different
%individual sizes, and therefore different convergence times, the stop
%condition will be established depending of the best fitness 
%(30 generations without improvement), to do a fair comparison.
%
%For a more complete knowledge of the search space and the parameters effects, 
%three different scenarios will be studied:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $S_1$: Maximization of the `villain' archetype ($A=1$).
%\item $S_2$: Maximization of the `villain' and the `hero' archetypes ($A=2$).
%\item $S_3$: Maximization of the `villain', the `hero' and the `avenger' archetypes ($A=3$).
%\end{itemize}
%
%Table \ref{tab:parameters} summarizes all the configuration parameters that will be compared (with their acronyms used in this paper),
%and the rest of the (fixed) parameters of the algorithm. The rest of the parameters of the MADE environment, such as the initial number of agents in the world, and the agent's parameters (such as the lifespan) are described in \cite{garcia14my}. In this paper we will use their default values as, in principle, they are not related with the aspects that model a story.

\section{Experiments and Results}
\label{sec:res}

%In this paper, 9720 runs were carried out for each problem/scenario (30 times * 4 levels for \emph{P} * 3 levels for \emph{D} * 3 levels for \emph{W} * 3 levels for \emph{S} * 3 levels for \emph{F} that represent the possible combinations) to obtain the fitness for each combination.
%
%Since the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test determines that the data we are using
%does not follow a normal distribution, a non-parametric test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, has been
%performed. 
%The response variable used to perform the statistical analysis is the
%fitness at the end of each run. 
%
%The tables obtained by Kruskal-Wallis test show for each factor the  degrees of freedom (FD), the experimental value of the statistical F (F value) and its associated p-value. If the output is smaller than 0.05, then the
%effect of this factor is statistically significant at $95\%$
%confidence level (which indicates that different initial values of
%this parameter lead to significant differences on the fitness).
%
%We have obtained values lower than 0.05 for all parameters in all scenarios (generated p-values tables have been omitted due to space constraints). These results show that all the parameters considered have a significant
%impact in the generation of the agents behavior. This confirm our hypothesis that the four elements that conform a story (time, characters, source of conflict and world) have a great repercussion in the generation of stories in the simulation environment.
%
%Since a significant p-value only tells  that the effects are not all
%equal (i.e., reject the null hypothesis), post-hoc tests might be used
%to determine which effects or outputs are significantly different from
%which other. 
%
%Therefore, a Kruskal-Wallis multi-comparison test has also been
%performed, showing significant differences among all parameter values,
%except for number of profiles (only using 1 profile has significant
%difference with respect to use 2, 4 and 8), and GA population size
%(64-128 and 128-256), both values (number of profiles and GA population size) in the scenarios $S_1$ and $S_2$. This
%can be explained because only one profile is necessary in these
%scenarios (as the hero and villain archetypes are based in attacking
%other rats, and therefore, can be shared by the same agent). Therefore, 
%the fitness function $F_1$ and $F_2$ only differs in counting the archetype of an `attacking' rat almost twice.

%All the results have also been plotted in order to better understand 
%their differences (in Figures \ref{fig:boxplotsP} to \ref{fig:boxplotsS}). At first glance, the median for D, W and F is 0 (or almost 0) for several
%values. This has several possible explanations: First, the
%number of profiles has quite an impact in the results (Figure
%\ref{fig:boxplotsP}), as it was shown previously in
%\cite{garcia14my}. 
%
%Increasing the number of profiles means changing the search problem
%from finding a single finite state automaton whose behavior
%eventually results in a world compatible with our search to finding
%two or more compatible with it and among themselves. This also happens
%independently of the situation and including complex ones, like the
%Avenger scenario, so for the time being we should conclude that a
%single profile, that is, having the description of a single FSM that
%describes the behavior of the agents in the world, is the best option for any scenario.

%A similar result is obtained for the number of days, whose results in

%amount of days (64) is not enough to allow the generation of any
%archetype, as there is no time to develop a story, or, in another
%words, for the events that we examine to compute fitness to occur, in
%most of the scenarios. This can also be said

%about the world dimension (Figure \ref{fig:boxplotsW}): larger worlds
%are more sparsely populated and have less interaction events, so the chances of an encounter that can trig an event (for
%example, a fight) is more difficult. 
%
%From the study of these two parameters we can conclude that, at least
%for these scenarios and possibly for any scenario, the baseline number
%of days should be 256 and the world for this population should have a
%small size of 25 cells.

%Finally, the amount of food (Figure \ref{fig:boxplotsF}), which is 
%the main source of conflicts, 
%also needs to be low enough so that it actually happens, in this case 1/8
%of the world size. 
%
%
%With respect to the GA population size, Figure \ref{fig:boxplotsS} shows visually the confirmation of the tests: there are significant differences in the values for the Scenario 3. Because the large exploration space of this problem it is clear that larger sizes, in combination with a stop criterion based in changes of the best individual found, can obtain a higher range of possible solution values.
